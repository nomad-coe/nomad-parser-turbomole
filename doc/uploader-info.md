# TURBOMOLE Parser

Please upload all input and output files from your TURBOMOLE calculations.
The TURBOMOLE parser will process all suitable primary output files from your uploaded calculations,
e.g. the output from the DSCF, RIDFT or RICC2 programs of the TURBOMOLE suite.
The parser always expects the "control" input to be in the same folder as the main calculation 
output file.

Any additional input files used by the calculation (e.g. basis set declaration, geometry and 
starting point information from a preceding calculation ) are expected to be found in the files 
specified by the control file and main output file.
Output files generated by the calculation (e.g. converged eigenstates of a HF calculation or the 
Hessian matrix in an vibrational analysis) are expected to be found at the locations reported in 
the main output file. 
The parser will automatically find and process these files as long as you  do not rename or move 
these files.

The TURBOMOLE parser does not require any special folder structure in your upload.

## Ignored Auxiliary Programs

The output from some programs of the TURBOMOLE suite does not provide any significant information 
for the NOMAD Repository and Archive.
Including these files in your upload does no harm, the parser will simply ignore these files and
not create any calculations associated with them.

At present, the output from the following programs is ignored:   

- define
- eiger
- dscfserver
- gradserver
